# Welcome to our 2024 programming blog
Team FRC 7913 Bearly Functioning is glad you could make it.

## Why are we doing this?
Here, we want to share our journey and the choices we make through the 
2024 Crescendo season so future teams and teammates can understand the decisions 
that go into a (hopefully) strong robot.

## How to use this
In the sidebar, explore the high-level choices we make.
Also, check out the [Releases]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link releases/index.md %}) 
for each version of the code we build and what we discovered in creating it.

## Contributing
For outside teams, we won't be accepting contributions to this blog 
unless you are contributing some amount of code and want to explain that.
For members of Team 7913, especially the programming team, 
please check out the [Documentation Process]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link documenting/documentation-process.md %}) page.
